Hodoor is casual attendance system. It is built for small to medium sized companies and teams, who don't need strict access control, but want to measure time spend on projects and/or at work.
Hodoor was developed, because my company [ELEDUS](http://www.eledus.cz/) needed such system and commercially available systems didn't met  our requirements (and I also wanted to learn Django). We wanted highly customized solution with nice features.Now we decided to open source it. Some features are not realy general / configurable, but we will work on it - be patient please :)

#Overview
Hoodor is Django Web Application with REST API, which can be accessed from clients or directly controlled via web interface. We are using our [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application (will be available soon) on Raspberry Pi with RFID scanner as front end.

What can Hodoor do:
* Record single actions (Swipes) 
* Insert Swipes into Sessions (Workdays)
* Measure Sessions time
* Assign Session time into projects
* Calculate Month statistics for Users
* Calculate Month Statistics of all users for Admins
* Can be accessed via REST API
* Can be accessed directly by web interface
* Can show Users at work / on break
